 Iâ€™m @GnomeOnMain, also known as Carter.
 You'll probably find some half finished projects here, maybe some completed ones too.
 I'm presently working on projects in C && Python
 If you somehow find my projects interesting or are curious about them in some way, don't hesitate to send me a mesage
 feel free to reach out to me on discord through "Former Gnome#1094"
