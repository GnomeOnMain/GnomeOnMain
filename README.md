 I'm the Gnome, found deep beneath the earth working on many a project.
 You'll probably find some half finished works here, maybe some completed ones too.
 I'm presently working on projects in C & Python, with some batch files and vb projects sprinkled in.
 If you somehow find my projects interesting or are curious about them in some way, don't hesitate to send me a message.
 Feel free to reach out to me on discord through "Former Gnome#1094"
